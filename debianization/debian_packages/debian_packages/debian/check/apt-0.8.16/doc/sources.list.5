.SH "NAME"
sources.list \- Package resource list for APT
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The package resource list is used to locate archives of the package distribution system in use on the system\&. At this time, this manual page documents only the packaging system used by the Debian GNU/Linux system\&. This control file is
/etc/apt/sources\&.list\&.
.PP
The source list is designed to support any number of active sources and a variety of source media\&. The file lists one source per line, with the most preferred source listed first\&. The format of each line is:
type uri args
The first item,
type
determines the format for
args\&.
uri
is a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), which is a superset of the more specific and well\-known Universal Resource Locator, or URL\&. The rest of the line can be marked as a comment by using a #\&.
.SH "SOURCES.LIST.D"
.PP
The
/etc/apt/sources\&.list\&.d
directory provides a way to add sources\&.list entries in separate files\&. The format is the same as for the regular
sources\&.list
file\&. File names need to end with
\&.list
and may only contain letters (a\-z and A\-Z), digits (0\-9), underscore (_), hyphen (\-) and period (\&.) characters\&. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored a file if the file doesn\*(Aqt match a pattern in the
Dir::Ignore\-Files\-Silently
configuration list \- in this case it will be silently ignored\&.
.SH "THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES"
.PP
The
deb
type describes a typical two\-level Debian archive,
distribution/component\&. Typically,
distribution
is generally an archivename like
stable
or
testing
or a codename like
squeeze
or
wheezy
while component is one of
main
contrib
or
non\-free\&. The
deb\-src
type describes a debian distribution\*(Aqs source code in the same form as the
deb
type\&. A
deb\-src
line is required to fetch source indexes\&.
.PP
The format for a
sources\&.list
entry using the
deb
and
deb\-src
types is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
deb [ options ] uri distribution [component1] [component2] [\&.\&.\&.]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The URI for the
deb
type must specify the base of the Debian distribution, from which APT will find the information it needs\&.
distribution
can specify an exact path, in which case the components must be omitted and
distribution
must end with a slash (/)\&. This is useful for when the case only a particular sub\-section of the archive denoted by the URI is of interest\&. If
distribution
does not specify an exact path, at least one
component
must be present\&.
.PP
distribution
may also contain a variable,
$(ARCH)
which expands to the Debian architecture (i386, m68k, powerpc, \&.\&.\&.) used on the system\&. This permits architecture\-independent
sources\&.list
files to be used\&. In general this is only of interest when specifying an exact path,
APT
will automatically generate a URI with the current architecture otherwise\&.
.PP
Since only one distribution can be specified per line it may be necessary to have multiple lines for the same URI, if a subset of all available distributions or components at that location is desired\&. APT will sort the URI list after it has generated a complete set internally, and will collapse multiple references to the same Internet host, for instance, into a single connection, so that it does not inefficiently establish an FTP connection, close it, do something else, and then re\-establish a connection to that same host\&. This feature is useful for accessing busy FTP sites with limits on the number of simultaneous anonymous users\&. APT also parallelizes connections to different hosts to more effectively deal with sites with low bandwidth\&.
.PP
options
is always optional and needs to be surounded by square brackets\&. It can consist of multiple settings in the form
\fIsetting\fR=\fIvalue\fR\&. Multiple settings are separated by spaces\&. The following settings are supported by APT, note though that unsupported settings will be ignored silently:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
arch=\fIarch1\fR,\fIarch2\fR,\&...
can be used to specify for which architectures packages information should be downloaded\&. If this option is not set all architectures defined by the
APT::Architectures
option will be downloaded\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
trusted=yes
can be set to indicate that packages from this source are always authenificated even if the
Release
file is not signed or the signature can\*(Aqt be checked\&. This disables parts of
\fBapt-secure\fR(8)
and should therefore only be used in a local and trusted context\&.
trusted=no
is the opposite which handles even correctly authenificated sources as not authenificated\&.
.RE
.PP
It is important to list sources in order of preference, with the most preferred source listed first\&. Typically this will result in sorting by speed from fastest to slowest (CD\-ROM followed by hosts on a local network, followed by distant Internet hosts, for example)\&.
.PP
Some examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
deb http://ftp\&.debian\&.org/debian squeeze main contrib non\-free
deb http://security\&.debian\&.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non\-free
   
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "URI SPECIFICATION"
.PP
The currently recognized URI types are cdrom, file, http, ftp, copy, ssh, rsh\&.
.PP
file
.RS 4
The file scheme allows an arbitrary directory in the file system to be considered an archive\&. This is useful for NFS mounts and local mirrors or archives\&.
.RE
.PP
cdrom
.RS 4
The cdrom scheme allows APT to use a local CDROM drive with media swapping\&. Use the
\fBapt-cdrom\fR(8)
program to create cdrom entries in the source list\&.
.RE
.PP
http
.RS 4
The http scheme specifies an HTTP server for the archive\&. If an environment variable
\fBhttp_proxy\fR
is set with the format http://server:port/, the proxy server specified in
\fBhttp_proxy\fR
will be used\&. Users of authenticated HTTP/1\&.1 proxies may use a string of the format http://user:pass@server:port/\&. Note that this is an insecure method of authentication\&.
.RE
.PP
ftp
.RS 4
The ftp scheme specifies an FTP server for the archive\&. APT\*(Aqs FTP behavior is highly configurable; for more information see the
\fBapt.conf\fR(5)
manual page\&. Please note that a ftp proxy can be specified by using the
\fBftp_proxy\fR
environment variable\&. It is possible to specify a http proxy (http proxy servers often understand ftp urls) using this method and ONLY this method\&. ftp proxies using http specified in the configuration file will be ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
copy
.RS 4
The copy scheme is identical to the file scheme except that packages are copied into the cache directory instead of used directly at their location\&. This is useful for people using a zip disk to copy files around with APT\&.
.RE
.PP
rsh, ssh
.RS 4
The rsh/ssh method invokes rsh/ssh to connect to a remote host as a given user and access the files\&. It is a good idea to do prior arrangements with RSA keys or rhosts\&. Access to files on the remote uses standard
\fBfind\fR
and
\fBdd\fR
commands to perform the file transfers from the remote\&.
.RE
.PP
more recognizable URI types
.RS 4
APT can be extended with more methods shipped in other optional packages which should follow the nameing scheme
apt\-transport\-\fImethod\fR\&. The APT team e\&.g\&. maintains also the
apt\-transport\-https
package which provides access methods for https\-URIs with features similar to the http method, but other methods for using e\&.g\&. debtorrent are also available, see
\fBapt-transport-debtorrent\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Uses the archive stored locally (or NFS mounted) at /home/jason/debian for stable/main, stable/contrib, and stable/non\-free\&.
.sp
.if n \{\

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
As above, except this uses the unstable (development) distribution\&.
.sp

.PP
Uses HTTP to access the archive at archive\&.debian\&.org, and uses only the hamm/main area\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
deb http://archive\&.debian\&.org/debian\-archive hamm main
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
Uses FTP to access the archive at ftp\&.debian\&.org, under the debian directory, and uses only the squeeze/contrib area\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
deb ftp://ftp\&.debian\&.org/debian squeeze contrib
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Uses FTP to access the archive at ftp\&.debian\&.org, under the debian directory, and uses only the unstable/contrib area\&. If this line appears as well as the one in the previous example in
sources\&.list
a single FTP session will be used for both resource lines\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
deb ftp://ftp\&.debian\&.org/debian unstable contrib
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Uses HTTP to access the archive at ftp\&.tlh\&.debian\&.org, under the universe directory, and uses only files found under
unstable/binary\-i386
on i386 machines,
unstable/binary\-amd64
on amd64, and so forth for other supported architectures\&. [Note this example only illustrates how to use the substitution variable; official debian archives are not structured like this]
