<h1>
APT Method Interface
<br>Chapter 2 - Specification
</h1>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1"></a>2.1 Overview</h2>

<p>
All methods operate as a sub process of a main controlling parent.  3 FD's are
opened for use by the method allowing two way communication and emergency error
reporting.  The FD's correspond to the well known unix FD's, stdin, stdout and
stderr.
</p>

<p>
Through operation of the method communication is done via http style plain
text.  Specifically RFC-822 (like the Package file) fields are used to describe
items and a numeric-like header is used to indicate what is happening.  Each of
these distinct communication messages should be sent quickly and without pause.
</p>

<p>
In some instances APT may pre-invoke a method to allow things like file URI's
to determine how many files are available locally.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.2"></a>2.2 Message Overview</h2>

<p>
The first line of each message is called the message header.  The first 3
digits (called the Status Code) have the usual meaning found in the http
protocol.  1xx is informational, 2xx is successful and 4xx is failure.  The 6xx
series is used to specify things sent to the method.  After the status code is
an informational string provided for visual debugging.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
100 Capabilities - Method capabilities
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
101 Log - General Logging
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
102 Status - Inter-URI status reporting (login progress)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
200 URI Start - URI is starting acquire
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
201 URI Done - URI is finished acquire
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
400 URI Failure - URI has failed to acquire
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
401 General Failure - Method did not like something sent to it
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
402 Authorization Required - Method requires authorization to access the URI.
Authorization is User/Pass
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
403 Media Failure - Method requires a media change
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
600 URI Acquire - Request a URI be acquired
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
601 Configuration - Sends the configuration space
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
602 Authorization Credentials - Response to the 402 message
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
603 Media Changed - Response to the 403 message
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only the 6xx series of status codes is sent TO the method.  Furthermore the
method may not emit status codes in the 6xx range.  The Codes 402 and 403
require that the method continue reading all other 6xx codes until the proper
602/603 code is received.  This means the method must be capable of handling an
unlimited number of 600 messages.
</p>

<p>
The flow of messages starts with the method sending out a <em>100
Capabilities</em> and APT sending out a <em>601 Configuration</em>.  After that
APT begins sending <em>600 URI Acquire</em> and the method sends out <em>200
URI Start</em>, <em>201 URI Done</em> or <em>400 URI Failure</em>.  No
synchronization is performed, it is expected that APT will send <em>600 URI
Acquire</em> messages at -any- time and that the method should queue the
messages.  This allows methods like http to pipeline requests to the remote
server.  It should be noted however that APT will buffer messages so it is not
necessary for the method to be constantly ready to receive them.

<dl>
<dt>102 Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Message gives a progress indication for the method.  It can be used to show

</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>200 URI Start</dt>

Resume-Point
</p>

<dl>
<dt>201 URI Done</dt>
<dd>

Indicates that a URI has completed being transfered.  It is possible to specify
a <em>201 URI Done</em> without a <em>URI Start</em> which would mean no data
was transfered but the file is now available.  A Filename field is specified
when the URI is directly available in the local pathname space.  APT will
either directly use that file or copy it into another location.  It is possible
to return Alt-* fields to indicate that another possibility for the URI has
been found in the local pathname space.  This is done if a decompressed version
of a .gz file is found.  Fields: URI, Size, Last-Modified, Filename, MD5-Hash
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>400 URI Failure</dt>

this message Fields: URI, Message
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>401 General Failure</dt>
<dd>
<p>

intended to check for invalid configuration options or other severe conditions.
Fields: Message
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>402 Authorization Required</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The method requires a Username and Password pair to continue.  After sending
this message the method will expect APT to send a <em>602 Authorization
Credentials</em> message with the required information.  It is possible for a
method to send this multiple times.  Fields: Site
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>403 Media Failure</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A method that deals with multiple media requires that a new media be inserted.
The Media field contains the name of the media to be inserted.  Fields: Media,
Drive
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>600 URI Acquire</dt>
<dd>
<p>
APT is requesting that a new URI be added to the acquire list.  Last-Modified
has the time stamp of the currently cache file if applicable.  Filename is the
name of the file that the acquired URI should be written to.  Fields: URI,
Filename Last-Modified
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>601 Configuration</dt>
<dd>
<p>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>603 Media Changed</dt>

This is sent in response to a <em>403 Media Failure</em> message.  It indicates
that the user has changed media and it is safe to proceed.  Fields: Media, Fail
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="s2.4"></a>2.4 Notes</h2>

<p>
The methods supplied by the stock apt are:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
cdrom - For Multi-Disc CDROMs
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
copy - (internal) For copying files around the filesystem
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="3" >
<li>
<p>
file - For local files
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="4" >
<li>
<p>
gzip - (internal) For decompression
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="5" >
<li>
<p>
http - For HTTP servers
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The two internal methods, copy and gzip, are used by the acquire code to
parallize and simplify the automatic decompression of package files as well as
copying package files around the file system.  Both methods can be seen to act
the same except that one decompresses on the fly.  APT uses them by generating
a copy URI that is formed identically to a file URI.  The destination file is
send as normal.  The method then takes the file specified by the URI and writes
it to the destination file.  A typical set of operations may be:
</p>

<pre>
     http://foo.com/Packages.gz -&gt; /bar/Packages.gz
     gzip:/bar/Packages.gz -&gt; /bar/Packages.decomp
     rename Packages.decomp to /final/Packages
</pre>

<p>
The http method implements a fully featured HTTP/1.1 client that supports deep
pipelining and reget.  It works best when coupled with an apache 1.3 server.
The file method simply generates failures or success responses with the
filename field set to the proper location.  The cdrom method acts the same
except that it checks that the mount point has a valid cdrom in it.  It does
this by (effectively) computing a md5 hash of 'ls -l' on the mountpoint.
