APT Files
<br>Chapter 2 - Files
</h1>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1"></a>2.1 Files and fragment directories in /etc/apt</h2>

<p>
All files in /etc/apt are used to modify specific aspects of APT.  To enable
other packages to ship needed configuration herself all these files have a
fragment directory packages can place their files in instead of mangling with
the main files.  The main files are therefore considered to be only used by the
user and not by a package.  The documentation omits this directories most of
the time to be easier readable, so every time the documentation includes a
reference to a main file it really means the file or the fragment directories.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.2"></a>2.2 Distribution Source list (sources.list)</h2>

<p>
The distribution source list is used to locate archives of the debian
distribution.  It is designed to support any number of active sources and to
support a mix of source media.  The file lists one source per line, with the
fastest source listed first.  The format of each line is:
</p>

<p>
<var>type uri args</var>
</p>

<p>
The first item, <var>type</var>, indicates the format for the remainder of the
line.  It is designed to indicate the structure of the distribution the line is
talking about.  Currently the only defined values are <em>deb</em> and
<em>deb-src</em> which indicate a standard debian (source) archive with a dists
directory.  More about these types and the URI specification can be found in
the sources.list manpage.
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s2.2.1"></a>2.2.1 Hashing the URI</h3>

<p>
All permanent information acquired from any of the sources is stored in the
lists directory.  Thus, there must be a way to relate the filename in the lists
directory to a line in the sourcelist.  To simplify things this is done by
quoting the URI and treating _'s as quoteable characters and converting / to _.
The URI spec says this is done by converting a sensitive character into %xx
where xx is the hexadecimal representation from the ASCII character set.
Examples:
</p>

<pre>
     http://www.debian.org/archive/dists/stable/binary-i386/Packages 
     /var/lib/apt/lists/www.debian.org_archive_dists_stable_binary-i386_Packages
     
     cdrom:Debian 1.3/debian/Packages
     /var/lib/apt/info/Debian%201.3_debian_Packages
</pre>

<p>
The other alternative that was considered was to use a deep directory structure
but this poses two problems, it makes it very difficult to prune directories
back when sources are no longer used and complicates the handling of the
partial directory.  This gives a very simple way to deal with all of the
situations that can arise.  Also note that the same rules described in the
<em>Archive Directory</em> section regarding the partial sub dir apply here as
well.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.3"></a>2.3 Extended States File (extended_states)</h2>

<p>
The extended_states file serves the same purpose as the normal dpkg status file
(/var/lib/dpkg/status) except that it stores information unique to apt.  This
includes currently only the autoflag but is open to store more unique data that
come up over time.  It duplicates nothing from the normal dpkg status file.
Please see other APT documentation for a discussion of the exact internal
behaviour of these fields.  The Package and the Architecture field are placed
directly before the new fields to indicate which package they apply to.  The
new fields are as follows:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Auto-Installed</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The Auto flag can be 1 (Yes) or 0 (No) and controls whether the package was
automatical installed to satisfy a dependency or if the user requested the
installation
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.4"></a>2.4 Binary Package Cache (srcpkgcache.bin and pkgcache.bin)</h2>

<p>
Please see cache.sgml for a complete description of what this file is.  The
cache file is updated whenever the contents of the lists directory changes.  If
the cache is erased, corrupted or of a non-matching version it will be
automatically rebuilt by all of the tools that need it.
<em>srcpkgcache.bin</em> contains a cache of all of the package files in the
source list.  This allows regeneration of the cache when the status files
change to use a prebuilt version for greater speed.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.5"></a>2.5 Downloads Directory (archives)</h2>

<p>
The archives directory is where all downloaded .deb archives go.  When the file
transfer is initiated the deb is placed in partial.  Once the file is fully
downloaded and its MD5 hash and size are verified it is moved from partial into
archives/.  Any files found in archives/ can be assumed to be verified.
</p>

<p>
No directory structure is transfered from the receiving site and all .deb file
names conform to debian conventions.  No short (msdos) filename should be
placed in archives.  If the need arises .debs should be unpacked, scanned and
renamed to their correct internal names.  This is mostly to prevent file name
conflicts but other programs may depend on this if convenient.  A conforming
.deb is one of the form, name_version_arch.deb.  Our archive scripts do not
handle epochs, but they are necessary and should be re-inserted.  If necessary
_'s and :'s in the fields should be quoted using the % convention.  It must be
possible to extract all 3 fields by examining the file name.  Downloaded .debs
must be found in one of the package lists with an exact name + version match..
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.6"></a>2.6 The Methods Directory (/usr/lib/apt/methods)</h2>

<p>
The Methods directory is more fully described in the APT Methods interface
document.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.7"></a>2.7 The Configuration File (/etc/apt/apt.conf)</h2>

<p>
The configuration file (and the associated fragments directory
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/) is described in the apt.conf manpage.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.8"></a>2.8 The trusted.gpg File (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg)</h2>

<p>
The trusted.gpg file (and the files in the associated fragments directory
/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/) is a binary file including the keyring used by apt to
validate that the information (e.g.  the Release file) it downloads are really
from the distributor it clams to be and is unmodified and is therefore the last
step in the chain of trust between the archive and the end user.  This security
system is described in the apt-secure manpage.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.9"></a>2.9 The Release File</h2>

<p>
This file plays an important role in how APT presents the archive to the user.
Its main purpose is to present a descriptive name for the source of each
version of each package.  It also is used to detect when new versions of debian
are released.  It augments the package file it is associated with by providing
meta information about the entire archive which the Packages file describes.
</p>

<p>
The full name of the distribution for presentation to the user is formed as
'label version archive', with a possible extended name being 'label version
archive component'.
</p>

<p>
The file is formed as the package file (RFC-822) with the following tags
defined:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Archive</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is the common name we give our archives, such as <em>stable</em> or
<em>unstable</em>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Component</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Refers to the sub-component of the archive, <em>main</em>, <em>contrib</em>
etc.  Component may be omitted if there are no components for this archive.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Version</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is a version string with the same properties as in the Packages file.  It
represents the release level of the archive.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Origin</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This specifies who is providing this archive.  In the case of Debian the string
will read 'Debian'.  Other providers may use their own string
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This carries the encompassing name of the distribution.  For Debian proper this
field reads 'Debian'.  For derived distributions it should contain their proper
name.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>
When the archive has packages for a single architecture then the Architecture
is listed here.  If a mixed set of systems are represented then this should
contain the keyword <em>mixed</em>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>NotAutomatic</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A Yes/No flag indicating that the archive is extremely unstable and its
version's should never be automatically selected.  This is to be used by
experimental.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Description is used to describe the release.  For instance experimental would
contain a warning that the packages have problems.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The location of the Release file in the archive is very important, it must be
located in the same location as the packages file so that it can be located in
all situations.  The following is an example for the current stable release,
1.3.1r6
</p>

<pre>
     Archive: stable
     Component: main
     Version: 1.3.1r6
     Origin: Debian
     Label: Debian
     Architecture: i386
</pre>

<p>
This is an example of experimental,
</p>

<pre>
     Archive: experimental
     Version: 0
     Origin: Debian
     Label: Debian
     Architecture: mixed
     NotAutomatic: Yes
</pre>

<p>
And unstable,
</p>

<pre>
     Archive: unstable
     Component: main
     Version: 2.1
     Origin: Debian
     Label: Debian
     Architecture: i386
</pre>
