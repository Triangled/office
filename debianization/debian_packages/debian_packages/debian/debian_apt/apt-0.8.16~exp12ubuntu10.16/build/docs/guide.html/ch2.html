<br>Chapter 2 - apt-get
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
<code>apt-get</code> provides a simple way to install packages from the command
line.  Unlike <code>dpkg</code>, <code>apt-get</code> does not understand .deb
files, it works with the package's proper name and can only install .deb
archives from a <em>Source</em>.
</p>

<p>
The first [<a href="footnotes.html#f1" name="fr1">1</a>] thing that should be
done before using <code>apt-get</code> is to fetch the package lists from the
<em>Sources</em> so that it knows what packages are available.  This is done
with <samp>apt-get update</samp>.  For instance,
</p>

<pre>
     # apt-get update
     Get http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian-non-US/ stable/binary-i386/ Packages
     Get http://llug.sep.bnl.gov/debian/ testing/contrib Packages
     Reading Package Lists... Done
     Building Dependency Tree... Done
</pre>

<p>
Once updated there are several commands that can be used:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>upgrade</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Upgrade will attempt to gently upgrade the whole system.  Upgrade will never
install a new package or remove an existing package, nor will it ever upgrade a
package that might cause some other package to break.  This can be used daily
to relatively safely upgrade the system.  Upgrade will list all of the packages
that it could not upgrade, this usually means that they depend on new packages
or conflict with some other package.  <code>dselect</code> or <samp>apt-get
install</samp> can be used to force these packages to install.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>install</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Install is used to install packages by name.  The package is automatically
fetched and installed.  This can be useful if you already know the name of the
package to install and do not want to go into a GUI to select it.  Any number
of packages may be passed to install, they will all be fetched.  Install
automatically attempts to resolve dependency problems with the listed packages
and will print a summary and ask for confirmation if anything other than its
arguments are changed.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>dist-upgrade</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Dist-upgrade is a complete upgrader designed to simplify upgrading between
releases of Debian.  It uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine the best
set of packages to install, upgrade and remove to get as much of the system to
the newest release.  In some situations it may be desired to use dist-upgrade
rather than spend the time manually resolving dependencies in
<code>dselect</code>.  Once dist-upgrade has completed then
<code>dselect</code> can be used to install any packages that may have been
left out.
</p>

<p>
It is important to closely look at what dist-upgrade is going to do, its
decisions may sometimes be quite surprising.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<code>apt-get</code> has several command line options that are detailed in its
man page, <code>apt-get(8)</code>.  The most useful option is <samp>-d</samp>
which does not install the fetched files.  If the system has to download a
large number of package it would be undesired to start installing them in case
something goes wrong.  When <samp>-d</samp> is used the downloaded archives can
be installed by simply running the command that caused them to be downloaded
again without <samp>-d</samp>.
